The 3 main questions that I had initially sought to answer through this project were "What were the top five most spoken languages in the U.S besides English in the past 10 years?", "What age group has the highest percentage of multilingual speakers in the U.S in the past 10 years?" and "What are the top five states in the U.S that have the highest percentage of multilingual speakers in the country?" While gathering my data, I discovered that answering these questions would be harder than I had initially anticipated, as the data I was finding focused more on specific groups of languages or specific speaking ability rather than generalized language data across the country. The dataset that I ended up using focused on 3 main categories of languages; Asian and Pacific Island languages, Indo-European languages, and Spanish. The data was separated by age groups, and gave values for how many 5-17 year olds, 18-64 year olds, and 65+ year olds spoke each of the respective language groups. I also noticed that the data had values for how well people spoke English based on the non English language they spoke. After uploading the dataset into R, I first removed all of the missing values in the dataset, and then I made a new dataset within R that included only the columns of the language group I wanted to analyze, each age group that spoke that language, and the states. I used the pivot_longer function to make copies of the state variable so that each age group could have a state assigned to it, and then I created stacked bar charts where I segmented each bar by proportions of age groups. I followed this process for both API languages and Spanish, and also looked at a comparison between people who generally speak API languages and people who speak API languages but English Well/Not Well and found the discrepancy between states and age groups to be quite interesting!

This is a segmented bar chart of the proportion of each age group that speaks Spanish out of the total population of people who speak Spanish in every state. The variable "ASQHE004" represents 5-17 year olds who speak Spanish, "ASQHE026" represents 18-64 year olds who speak Spanish, and "ASQHE048" represents 65+ year olds who speak Spanish. I found it interesting that there was such a high proportion of Spanish speakers who were young across all the states, and how states like Alabama had a higher proportion of Spanish speakers who were young than California.

This is a segmented bar chart of the proportion of each age group that speaks Asian or Pacific Island languages out of the total population of people who speak Asian or Pacific Island languages in every state. The variable "ASQHE014" represents 5-17 year olds who speak API languages, "ASQHE036" represents 18-64 year olds who speak API languages, and "ASQHE058" represents 65+ year olds who speak API languages. It was interesting to see how the graph flips a bit here and the proportion of people who speak API languages and are older is higher across the board than the proportion of people who speak API languages and are younger.

This is a segmented bar chart of the proportion of each age group that speaks Asian or Pacific Island languages and English well out of the total population of people who speak Asian or Pacific Island languages and English well in every state. The variable "ASQHE015" represents 5-17 year olds who speak API languages and English well, "ASQHE037" represents 18-64 year olds who speak API languages and English well, and "ASQHE059" represents 65+ year olds who speak API languages and English well. As I had expected, the proportion of older people here decrease and the proportion of younger people here increase, as it is harder for older people to learn new languages.

This is a segmented bar chart of the proportion of each age group that speaks Asian or Pacific Island languages but not English well out of the total population of people who speak Asian or Pacific Island languages but not English well in every state. The variable "ASQHE017" represents 5-17 year olds who speak API languages but not English well, "ASQHE039" represents 18-64 year olds who speak API languages but not English well, and "ASQHE061" represents 65+ year olds who speak API languages but not English well. As expected, the proportion of older people was much higher here in comparison to the graph of people who spoke API languages and English well, but the outlier of young people in North Dakota was interesting!
